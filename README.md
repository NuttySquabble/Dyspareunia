# Dyspareunia

*Dyspareunia (noun) â€“ difficult or painful sexual intercourse.*

This mod introduces a wear & tear system to RimJobWorld.

## Features

- Penetrating sex may damage pawns' "tender parts", causing abrasions and/or ruptures
- Amount of damage depends on the relative size of the organ, participants' traits, wetness and whether the sex is consensual
- Vaginas and anuses stretch from being penetrated by bigger penises
- However, they also gradually contract over time until they reach 50% ("average") size
- Tight penetrations give both partners positive thoughts (except to the penetrated rape victim)

## Requirements & Load Order

- RimWorld (Core)
- Harmony
- RimJobWorld
- Dyspareunia (this mod)

## Notes

- This is a beta. Expect many features to be added or changed
- There is a degree of randomness in dealing damage, so no two intercourses are the same
- See plans and known issues here: https://github.com/NuttySquabble/Dyspareunia/issues
